Incremental 24.7.0 would produce an error when parsing the ``pyproject.toml`` of a project that lacked the ``use_incremental=True`` or ``[tool.incremental]`` opt-in markers if that file lacked a ``[project]`` section containing the package name. This could cause a project that only uses ``pyproject.toml`` to configure tools to fail to build if Incremental is installed. Incremental now ignores such projects.
